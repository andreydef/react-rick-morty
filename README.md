#
### I created an application that allows you to work with the ready open API Rick and Morty (https://rickandmortyapi.com/api) using the REST API in the project on React.js. The application has a convenient navigation that allows you to switch between the pages characters, locations, episodes, which display information from the Rick and Morty API. Also, implemented filtering with text and with ready-made options for all objects on the site.
